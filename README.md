## Description
#### To play the game, simply click on the gems to match the target value; winning or losing will give a new target value and change the values of each gem.

## Requirements
#### The assignment required making a game using jQuery to dynamically update my HTML page

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- jQuery
- Javascript

## Code Explaination
- First I created a variable to hold the value of the target value and printed it to my HTML
- Then I created a variable to hold the current value the user has and initilized it to 0
- Then I used jQuery to add value attributes to each of the gems
- I created an on click method for the button classes to do several things:
	- Pull the value from each gem
	- Update the current score using the gem values
	- Check if the user has won or lost the current game
		- Start a new game whether the user has won or lost
